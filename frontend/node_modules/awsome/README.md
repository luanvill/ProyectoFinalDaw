## Getting Started

Make your AWS credentials available in the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables and then just import AWSome to get started.

```javascript
// Import AWSome
const awsome = require('awsome')

// Create a new bucket instance
const bucket = new awsome.Bucket({ name: 'my-test-bucket' })

// Fetch the bucket data
bucket.retrieve()
      .then((data) => {
        // Good stuff, enjoy the data
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        // Something happened and the bucket data could not be retrieved
      })
```

## Examples

Get started with the examples provided to **create**, **retrieve**, **update** or **delete** buckets and to **host**, **unhost** domains as well as to **link** and **unlink** domains and buckets. Make sure you have your AWS key and secret ready.
