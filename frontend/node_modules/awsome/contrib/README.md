## Thanks for considering contributing to AWSOME

We'd love to have you join the core team and start developing with us.

**Fork The AWSOME Repository**

Start by forking this repository. Here's an [intro to forking a GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) if you need a refresher.

**Install The Dependencies**

Make sure you've got all your dependencies up to date.

```
npm i
```

**Work On An Existing Issue**

All changes should work towards solving existing issues. If you want to add value but your issue does not exist, that's great. Make sure you create an issue first. Have a look at the [current issues](https://github.com/fluidtrends/awsome/issues) to figure out what you'd like to work on.

**Run The Tests**

Ensure all your tests pass before finishing your work.

```
npm test
```

**Run The Coverage**

Check to make sure your coverage is as close as possible to 100%.

```
npm run coverage
```

**Create A Pull Request**

Make sure you create a pull request when you're ready to commit your changes. Here's a tutorial about [creating a GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) if you need it.
